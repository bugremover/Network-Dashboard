# 🌐 Network Monitoring Dashboard (Frontend)

A **futuristic and real-time dashboard** for visualizing and monitoring your system's network activity. Built with a sleek UI, this dashboard helps identify bandwidth usage, latency spikes, and unusual patterns.

## ⚙️ System Architecture Overview

```plaintext
+-------------+        API (Netdata/Custom)       +-------------+
|  Networked  |  --->  [ REST / WebSocket API ]  --->  Frontend |
|  Device(s)  |                                    |  Dashboard |
+-------------+                                    +-------------+
         ^                                               |
         |_______________________________________________|
                  ←── Realtime Fetch & Update ──→
```

## 📊 Feature Workflow Breakdown

### 1. **Traffic Monitoring Flow**

```plaintext
+---------+      +------------+      +--------------------+      +--------------+
| Device  | ---> | Netdata or | ---> | API Endpoint (GET) | ---> | UI: Chart.js |
| Network |      | Custom API |      |  /api/traffic      |      | Upload/Down  |
+---------+      +------------+      +--------------------+      +--------------+
```

🔁 This fetches real-time bandwidth usage and displays it in a beautiful live-updating line chart.

---

### 2. **Latency Monitoring**

```plaintext
+-------------+      +------------------+      +---------------+
| Ping Server | ---> | /api/latency     | ---> | Latency Chart |
+-------------+      +------------------+      +---------------+
```

- ⚡ Ping requests are sent periodically.
- 🔄 Frontend updates with RTT (Round Trip Time) graphs.

---

### 3. **Suspicious Activity Alerts**

```plaintext
+------------------+    +----------------+    +-----------------------+
| System Analyzer  | -> | /api/alerts    | -> | Alert Cards / Toasts |
| (Anomaly Logic)  |    | (e.g. spikes)  |    | + Timestamp + Type   |
+------------------+    +----------------+    +-----------------------+
```

🧠 Uses logic like:
- Port scanning detection
- Unusual spike in traffic
- Excessive latency

## 🧠 How the Dashboard Works (Internally)

1. **Real-time API Calls** – every few seconds the frontend fetches new data or listens over a socket.
2. **Reactive UI** – the charts and cards re-render instantly using state management.
3. **Modular Code** – each component is reusable and scoped for scalability.
4. **Security-focused** – sanitized inputs, no direct hardware access, read-only APIs.
